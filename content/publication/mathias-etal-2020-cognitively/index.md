abstract: Automatic essay grading (AEG) is a process in which machines assign a grade
  to an essay written in response to a topic, called the prompt. Zero-shot AEG is
  when we train a system to grade essays written to a new prompt which was not present
  in our training data. In this paper, we describe a solution to the problem of zero-shot
  automatic essay grading, using cognitive information, in the form of gaze behaviour.
  Our experiments show that using gaze behaviour helps in improving the performance
  of AEG systems, especially when we provide a new essay written in response to a
  new prompt for scoring, by an average of almost 5 percentage points of QWK.
